## Brief Overview of EasyShop

The EasyShop Application project allows for several bug fixes to be changed then run test in Postman. The test consist of the debugging in the controllers, the multiple DAOs, and in the MySQL workbench that contains our database. With these changes, we can make the connection of seeing how both the front and backend of coding can end up
collaborating with each other to create a result that a user can notice the outcome from those results. While the frontend provides the visuals of how everything can look
through the UI, backend provides the functionality of the project and tie everything in with the logic behind it all.

## Project Requirements for Operation

After confirming the settings for your SpringBoot Application, complete the following steps:
1. Generate the folder that will now become a zip folder.
2. Unzip the folder by extracting all contents inside of the folder with the EXTRACT ALL command in the file explorer.

## Preplan of EasyShop

While being provided the workshop that was written by someone else, there were several areas where we need to debug the code to make it functional. We were already
notified in different sections of where the bugs were and needed to promptly change them. Based on that, I have linked a project board to this repo to help assist me in making sure that I continue on the plans being made to complete the required section(s).
