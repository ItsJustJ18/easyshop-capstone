## Brief Overview of EasyShop

The EasyShop Application project allows for several bug fixes to be changed then run test in Postman. The test consist of the debugging in the controllers, the multiple DAOs, and in the MySQL workbench that contains our database. With these changes, we can make the connection of seeing how both the front and backend of coding can end up
collaborating with each other to create a result that a user can notice the outcome from those results.
